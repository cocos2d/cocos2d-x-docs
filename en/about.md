## Where to get Cocos2d-x and what do I get?
You can clone the [__GitHub Repo__](https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x) and follow the steps in the [__README__](https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/blob/v3/README.md). You can also download as part of the Cocos package on our [__download page__](http://cocos2d-x.org/download). No matter if you choose to develop in C++, JavaScript or Lua, everything you need is in one package. The Cocos family of products has a few different pieces.

  * __Cocos2d-x__ - this is the game engine, itself. It includes the engine and the
  [__cocos__](http://cocos2d-x.org/docs/editors_and_tools/cocosCLTool/index.html) command-line tool. You can download a [__production__](http://cocos2d-x.org/download)
  release or stay bleeding edge by cloning our [__GitHub Repo__](https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x).

  * __Cocos Creator__ - is a unified game development tool. You can create your
  entire game, from start to finish, using this tool. It uses JavaScript. Lua and
  C++ support are being added. Read more about [__Cocos Creator__](http://cocos2d-x.org/docs/editors_and_tools/creator/index.html).

  * __Cocos Launcher__ - is a graphical tool to create and manage your projects.
  This is also an easy way to add SDKBOX plugins to your project. [__Documentaion__](http://cocos2d-x.org/docs/cocos/cocos/index.html)
  is available.

  * __Coco Studio__ - is EOL'd and has been replaced by __Cocos Creator__. [__Documentation__](http://cocos2d-x.org/docs/deprecated/studio/index.html)
  is still available.

  * __Code IDE__ -  is EOL'd. Common text editors and IDE's can be used instead.
