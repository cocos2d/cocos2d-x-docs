## Sequences and Spawns
With moving `Sprite` objects on the screen we have everything we need to create
our game, right? Not quite. What about running multiple __Actions__? Yes,
Cocos2d-x handles this too in a few different ways.

Just like it sounds, a `Sequence` is multiple `Action` objects run in a specified
order. Need to run the `Sequence` in reverse? No problem, Cocos2d-x handles
this with no additional work.

Take a look at the flow of an example `Sequence` for moving a `Sprite`
gradually:

![](basic_concepts-img/2_sequence_scaled.png "")

This `Sequence` is easy to make:

```cpp
auto mySprite = Node::create();

// move to point 50,10 over 2 seconds
auto moveTo1 = MoveTo::create(2, Vec2(50,10));

// move from current position by 100,10 over 2 seconds
auto moveBy1 = MoveBy::create(2, Vec2(100,10));

// move to point 150,10 over 2 seconds
auto moveTo2 = MoveTo::create(2, Vec2(150,10));

// create a delay
auto delay = DelayTime::create(1);

mySprite->runAction(Sequence::create(moveTo1, delay, moveBy1, delay.clone(),
moveTo2, nullptr));
```

This example runs a `Sequence`, in order, but what about running all the
specified __Actions__ at the same time? Cocos2d-x supports this too and it
is called `Spawn`. `Spawn` will take all the specified `Action` objects and
executes them at the same time. Some might be longer than others, so they won't
all finish at the same time if this is the case.

```cpp
auto myNode = Node::create();

auto moveTo1 = MoveTo::create(2, Vec2(50,10));
auto moveBy1 = MoveBy::create(2, Vec2(100,10));
auto moveTo2 = MoveTo::create(2, Vec2(150,10));

myNode->runAction(Spawn::create(moveTo1, moveBy1, moveTo2, nullptr));
```

Why `Spawn` actions? Is there ever a reason? Sure! What if your main
character has multiple __Actions__ when obtaining a power up? Maybe beating
the boss at the end of a level has multiple __Actions__ that need to happen
to end the level.
