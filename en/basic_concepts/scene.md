## Scenes and the Scene Graph
In your game you probably want a main menu, a few levels and an ending scene. How do you organize all of these into the separate pieces they are? You guessed it, `Scene`. When you think about your favorite movie you can see that it's distinctly broken down into scenes, or separate parts of the story line. If we apply this same thought process to games, we should come up with at least a few scenes no matter how simple the game is.

Taking another look at the familiar image from earlier:

This is a main menu and it is a single `Scene`. This scene is made up of several pieces that all fit together to give us the end result. Scenes are drawn by the __renderer__. The __renderer__ is responsible for gathering everything that should be on the screen, and how it should look and getting it there. To better understand this we need to talk a bit about the __scene graph__.

### Scene Graph
A __scene graph__ is a data structure that arranges a graphical scene. A __scene graph__ contains `Node` objects in a tree (yes, it is called __scene graph__, but it is actually represented by a __tree__) structure.

It sounds and looks complicated. I'm sure you are asking why should you care about this technical detail if __Cocos2d-x__ does the heavy lifting for you? It really is important to understand how `Scene` objects are drawn by the renderer.

Once you start adding `Node`, `Sprite` and `Animation` objects to your game, you want to make sure you are drawing the things you expect. But, what if you are not?  What
if your `Sprite` objects are hidden in the background and you want them to be the foremost objects? No big deal, just take a step back and run through the __scene graph__ on a piece of paper, and I bet you find your mistake easily.

Since the __Scene Graph__ is a tree; you can __walk the tree__. __Cocos2d-x__ uses the __in-order walk__ algorithm. An __in-order walk__ is the left side of the tree being walked, then the root node, then the right side of the tree. Since the right side of the tree is rendered last, it is displayed first on the __scene graph__.

The __scene graph__ is easily demonstrated, let's take a look at our game scene broken down:

![](basic_concepts-img/2n_main.png "")

This example game scene would be rendered as a tree, simplified to the following:

![](basic_concepts-img/2n_mainScene-sceneGraph.png "")

Another point to think about is elements with a negative __z-order__ are on the left side of the tree, while elements with a positive __z-order__ are on the right
side.  Keep this in consideration when ordering your elements! Of course, you can add elements in any order, and they're automatically sorted based upon a customizable __z-order__.

Building on this concept, we can think of a `Scene` as a collection of `Node` objects. Let's break the scene above down to see the __scene graph__ uses the __z-order__ to layout the `Scene`:

![](basic_concepts-img/layers.png "")

The `Scene` on the left is actually made up of multiple `Node` objects
that are given a different __z-order__ to make them **stack** on top of each other.

In __Cocos2d-x__, you build the __scene graph__ using the __addChild()__ API call:

```cpp
// Adds a child with the z-order of -2, that means
// it goes to the "left" side of the tree (because it is negative)
scene->addChild(title_node, -2);

// When you don't specify the z-order, it will use 0
scene->addChild(label_node);

// Adds a child with the z-order of 1, that means
// it goes to the "right" side of the tree (because it is positive)
scene->addChild(sprite_node, 1);
```

### Let's Build A Game - Step 4
Continuing with building our game, we need to think about our game and what `Scene` objects we will need. Some games use just a single `Scene` object. This works by removing all `Node` objects from a scene and replacing them with new `Node` objects that make up the next `Scene`. This is a valid approach. Another approach might be to break the game down into a **main menu** and a **game scene**. A third approach might be to break the game down further into a **main menu**, **level 1** -> **level N** and finally a **closing scene**. You may even add a small transition, often called a **cut scene** between the vavious `Scene` objects. Perhaps these **cut scenes** continue telling a story or just visually stimluate the user while the next level is loading in the background.

In this game, let us take the approach of breaking down our game into an **intro scene**, **game scene** and a **closing scene**. To do this, we need to make 3 almost entirely identical classes, at least to start with. These classes will change as we work on each one of these parts of our game. There are arguments amongst programmers on having to many or to few classes. Let's save that debate for a later time. For now, the goal is to be as clear as possible so those new to c++ and game development don't struggle to learn both at the same time. 

Let's add the classes we mentioned above now. Classes are just source files. You can create them from the command-line or your favorite text editor. If you are using an IDE there may even be a __wizard__ you can run if you are new to class creation.

The first class is our **intro scene**. Let's block out a basic class
