## Main Components
It might seem overwhelming at first, but getting started with Cocos2d-x is
simple. Before we dive into depth we must understand some of the concepts
Cocos2d-x utilizes. At the heart of Cocos2d-x are `Scene`, `Node`, `Sprite`,
`Menu` and `Action` objects. Look at any of your favorite games, and you will
see all of these components in one form or another!

Let's have a look. This might look a bit similar to a very popular game you might have played:

Let's take another look, but splitting up the screenshot and identifying the
components used to build it:

You can see a menu, some sprites and labels, which all have an equivalent in
Cocos2d-x.  Take a look at a few of your own game design documents, and see what
components you have, you'll probably have a few that match up.
