## Getting Started
You are using `Sprite`, `Label` and `Action` objects in your game and it is making progress. Besides the basic `Node` types described in previous chapters, Cocos2d-x also provides more advanced `Node` types to help build special functionality. Perhaps you want to make a __tile-based__ game? Or maybe a __2d side scroller__? Or maybe you want to add particle effects to your game? Cocos2d-x provides `Node` objects to help you accomplish these goals!
