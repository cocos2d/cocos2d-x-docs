## Audio
Your game will surely need sound! Cocos2d-x provides an audio engine called
`SimpleAudioEngine`. It can be used to play background music as well as sound effects through out your game play. `SimpleAudioEngine` is a shared singleton object so you can simple call it from anywhere in your code. When creating a sample __HelloWorld__ project we do all the setup required for you, out of the box. It also supports a variety of formats, including __mp3__
and __Core Audio Format__.
