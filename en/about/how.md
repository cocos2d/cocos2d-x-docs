  -   Commit your changes in your own repository
  -   Create a new branch with your patch: `$ git checkout -b my_fix_branch`
  -   Push your new branch to your public repository
  -   Send a “pull request” to user “cocos2d”

  -   It must follow the _Releases_ rules. See the definition below

#### Only _complete_ patches will be merged
The patch must be _complete_. By that, we mean:

  -   For C++ code follow the [Cocos2d C++ Coding Style](https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/blob/v3/docs/CODING_STYLE.md)
  -   For Python code follow the [PEP8 guidelines](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008)
  -   Describe what the patch does
  -   Include test cases if applicable
  -   Include unit tests if applicable
  -   Must be tested in all supported platforms. If you don't have access to test your code in all the supported platforms, let us know.
  -   Must NOT degrade the performance
  -   Must NOT break existing tests cases
  -   Must NOT break the Continuous Integration build
  -   Must NOT break backward compatibility
  -   Must compile WITHOUT warnings
  -   New APIs MUST be **easy to use**, **familiar** to cocos2d-x users
  -   Code MUST be **easy to extend** and **maintain**
  -   Must have documentation: C++ APIs must use Doxygen strings, tools must have a README.md file that describe how to use the tool
  -   Must be efficient (fast / low memory needs)
  -   It must not duplicate existing code, unless the new code deprecates the old one
  -   Patches that refactor key components will only be merged in the next major versions.
