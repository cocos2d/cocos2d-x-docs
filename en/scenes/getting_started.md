## What is a Scene?
A `Scene` is a container that holds `Sprites`, `Labels`, `Nodes` and other
objects that your game needs. A `Scene` is responsible for running game logic and rendering the content on a per-frame basis. You need at least one `Scene` to start your game. You can think of this like a movie. The `Scene` is what is running and users see what is happening in real-time. You can have any number of `Scene` objects in your game and transition through them easily. Cocos2d-x provides __scene transitions__ and you can even have __scene transitions__ with cool effects.
