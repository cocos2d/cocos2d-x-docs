## Keyboard events
For desktop games, you might want find using keyboard mechanics useful.
Cocos2d-x supports keyboard events. Just like with touch events above,
keyboard events are easy to create.

```cpp
// creating a keyboard event listener
auto listener = EventListenerKeyboard::create();
listener->onKeyPressed = CC_CALLBACK_2(KeyboardTest::onKeyPressed, this);
listener->onKeyReleased = CC_CALLBACK_2(KeyboardTest::onKeyReleased, this);

_eventDispatcher->addEventListenerWithSceneGraphPriority(listener, this);

// Implementation of the keyboard event callback function prototype
void KeyboardTest::onKeyPressed(EventKeyboard::KeyCode keyCode, Event* event)
{
        log("Key with keycode %d pressed", keyCode);
}

void KeyboardTest::onKeyReleased(EventKeyboard::KeyCode keyCode, Event* event)
{
        log("Key with keycode %d released", keyCode);
}
```
