# Cocos Creator v2.0.9 released!
__Cocos Creator__ __v2.0.9__ support for the **Baidu games** platform and greatly optimizes the performance of **DragonBones**/**Spine** on small games and web platforms. **WeChat mini games** also brings improved resource loading performance and dynamic text refresh efficiency. At the same time, we have further improved the compatibility and stability of the engine and editor, so that everyone can get a better development experience. Good quality is inseparable from careful polishing. Thanks to the feedback from developers on the community, GitHub, Cocos corporate services and other channels.

The following is a description of the changes relative to __v2.0.9__:

# What's New

## Support for publishing to Baidu small game platform

__Cocos Creator__ officially supports releasing to __Baidu games__. For detailed usage, please refer to [Publish to Baidu Small Game Platform](https://docs.cocos.com/creator/manual/en/publish/publish-baidugame.html).

## Improving the performance of DragonBones and Spine on non-native platforms

__Cocos Creator__ __v2.0.7__ greatly optimized the performance of __DragonBones__ and __Spine__ on **native platforms**, with performance optimized to more than twice as fast as 1.9 and 1.10. This release, __v2.0.9__, for **Web platforms** and **non-native platforms**. **SHARED_CACHE** and **PRIVATE_CACHE** **acceleration modes**, have improved **DragonBones** performance by **15** times, and **Spine's** performance has improved by **3 - 6** times.

Performance test results after acceleration mode is enabled:

> The score of the test is converted from the frame rate and the number of animations. The higher the value, the better the performance.

When playing more than three animations on the same screen, **SHARED_CACHE** acceleration mode can also greatly reduce memory overhead. The following is a memory comparison of one hundred animations on the same screen:

> The lower the score of the test, the less memory is occupied. The more animations SHARED_CACHE saves more memory.

To enable **Extreme Mode**, simply set the __Animation Cache Mode__ to **SHARED_CACHE** or **PRIVATE_CACHE** on the **DragonBones** or **Spine** components. For more detailed information on speed modes, refer to the [Dragonbones reference documentation](https://docs.cocos2d-x.org/creator/manual/en/components/dragonbones.html) and [Spine reference documentation](https://docs.cocos2d-x.org/creator/manual/en/components/spine.html)

## Support for publishing as Android App Bundle

In **Build panel**, publishing to __Android App bundles** has been added. When checked, __Android native games__ can be published as __App Bundles__. After submitting the __App Bundle__ to __Google Play__, __Google Play__ will dynamically download different versions of the __APK__ based on the differences in the player's phone parameters to reduce the game's package size.
