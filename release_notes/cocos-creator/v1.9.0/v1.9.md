### DEPRECATION
 - As of v1.8.2, cc.eventManager is no longer recommended. Use cc.EventTarget or cc.systemEvent instead. The original API will be removed in 2.0.
 - As of v1.8.2, cc.inputManager is no longer recommended. Use the same interface as cc.systemEvent instead. The original API will be removed in 2.0.
 - As of v1.8.2, dragonBones.CCFactory.getFactory is no longer recommended. Please use dragonBones.CCFactory.getInstance instead. The original API will be removed in 2.0.

### KNOWN ISSUES

 - When copying and pasting resources in the Assets panel, the resource properties will still not be copied. (Since 1.9.0)
 - On a native platform, calling the `action.easing(cc.ease***)` method may cause the node's logical data to be out of sync. Please use `new cc.Ease***(action)` instead. (Since 1.8.2)

### QQ Play Known Issues:

At present, QQ Play is still in AB Test. Developers are also required to obtain internal beta qualification in order to develop, and currently only support compiling on Mac. In addition, our adaptation work on QQ Play has not been completely completed yet. The following modules are still not supported at present:

 - Label: ttf is not supported, system font can only use the default font
 - Particle system: Map data is not supported in plist. Only texture urls are supported.
 - WebView
 - VideoPlayer
 - DeviceMotion

The above functions are expected to be supported one by one in future updates. We will also continue to closely communicate with QQ Play's engineers to continuously optimize the matching effect.
