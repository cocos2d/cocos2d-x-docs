# Cocos Creator 1.2 released!

We are thrilled to release v1.2 version which focuses on performance improvements covering both Web and JSB platforms. Developers who started a game with v1.0 now can get a free performance boost!

## 1.2 Main Features

- Build to Lua Engine
- WebGL auto batching and culling
- Canvas rendering with dirty region optimization
- Graphics drawing system
- Refactored Properties panel supporting customized elements
- Modular JavaScript Engine
- AnySDK support

## Build to Lua Engine

After two months of development and collaboration between the creator of Cocos2d-x Lua engine, Yulei Liao, and Cocos Creator team, finally we are able to build scene and UI to be used in Cocos2d-x Lua engine now!

The current Creator to Lua workflow:

- Make and edit scene and UI in Creator, you can also manage project assets in it.

- In Build panel, choose `Lua` as the target platform.

- Convert built files to lua files with the convert tool.

- Next just use the standard cocos2d-x Lua engine workflow to add game scripts and then use Cocos Console for compiling and running.

We will keep updating Lua support for Creator. Next steps includes making the convert tool a plugin for Creator and generate standard Cocos2d-x Lua project, also we will add component system for Lua that you can bind data for your components in Creator editor.

## Rendering Optimization for Web and JSB

In Cocos2d-x 3.11 and 3.12 we added WebGL auto batching and culling that can increase performance drastically. Now in Cocos Creator v1.2 we have includes all the WebGL optimization. If you have your images packed in atlas properly you'll see performance boost that at least 5 times better than last released version. The auto culling feature make sure that only sprites and labels you can see generates render commands, this will help supporting large scene and tilemap for your game.

For Android browsers that doesn't support WebGL, the newly added dirty region optimization specifically for Canvas Rendering mode also brings 2 times of performance boost. You can also disable this optimization for Canvas rendering with API if your scene consists of moving elements mainly.


## Graphics Drawing System

From Creator v0.7 to v1.1, the beloved `cc.DrawNode` API were always absent. In v1.2 let's welcome `cc.Graphics`, a superior, fully upgraded version of graphic drawing API system. Besides covering all of `cc.DrawNode's` functionality, `cc.Graphics` supports SVG vector format including static and animated graphics. You can get tens of thousands shared vector graphics from internet to spice up your game (be sure to check their license)! It's also great for procedure graphic fans, let's get started now!

## Customizable Properties Panel for Components

We refactored Properties panel, that would probably be the first thing you notice when launching v1.2 for the first time since the panel looks way different now. Besides the looking, developers get the performance boost and more importantly, the ability to write custom property elements for your components. You can easily make visual property control like Widget component and make your designers very happy.

## Modular JavaScript Engine

We added a new tab **Module Config** for Project Settings panel in v1.2, that you can customize what engine module should be included in JavaScript build. For now you can effectively reduce engine library size by 1/3 if you don't need many modules. Later we will further slicing engine up to make built engine even more tiny.

## AnySDK Support

We have include AnySDK C++ library in v1.2 native build. You don't need to do anything before you can call its API in your script to generate base package.

In the near future we will release an __AnySDK__ plugin for Creator that you can finish the whole SDK workflow with fully graphical interface without leaving Cocos Creator.
