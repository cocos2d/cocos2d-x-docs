## Full Release Notes from v1.1
### Import Project from Cocos Studio / Cocos Builder

As the newest member of Cocos engine family, it's very important to have data compatibility with scene building tools like Cocos Studio and Cocos Builder. In the new release users can use the 'Import project...' menu item from main menu to import ccs and ccb project file.

Assets that can be imported including: Scene, Layer, Node, Texture, Scene Timeline, Particle and Audio. Due to the big difference between object oriented and component scripting system, the source code won't be imported.

### Collider Component System

Physics and collision are key elements of action games. We have received tons of feedback asking for physics engine support. In v1.1 we added Collider Component system so that you can easily use Cocos Creator to develop action based games!

<img src="0a645b1f5590a709.jpg" width="690" height="360"> 

First, once we attach a Collider component to a node, we can specify shape, size and position of the collider. For certain shape of colliders you can also edit control points freely to create any shape you like.

We also add a 'Group' property for Node, by setting group collision rules we can control wether a node should collide with other nodes from a certain group.

You can register a callback function on a component attached to the same node. So that when collision happens, the callback function is called with arguments including the other collider and the collider itself. Then you can write any logic code to handle the collision to perform the desire behavior.

Since 3rd party physics engines are generally large and most games will only use small portion of it. We didn't include any physics engine in the release.

### Engine Customization Workflow

Engine customization is always one of the highlight feature of Cocos engine family. Cocos Creator v1.1 contains full engine customization worfklow. There are two layers of engine customization: JavaScript and C++. If you work on Web project you only need JavaScript engine, if you work on cross-platform or one of the native platform you'll need to customize C++ engine as well.

The JavaScript and C++ engines are now available on Github, forks and pull requests are welcome!

- C++ Engine: https://github.com/cocos-creator/cocos2d-x-lite

### Refined Assets Loading API

We simplified and optimized assets loading API, now you can use `cc.loader.loadRes` to load any assets with consistent url format. And you should not including asset file extension in the url. Instead, you can pass a second argument to specify the type of asset you want to load.

We also add `cc.loader.loadResAll` that supports inputing a folder url and load all assets in that folder.

For dynamic scene loading, this release also includes `cc.director.preloadScene` to handle all the scene assets preloading.

### Node Library

<img src="715de315b8e4d235.jpg" width="335" height="500"> 

In this new panel you can drag and drop node and UI elements to the Scene or Node Tree to easily create them. User can also drag prefab assets from Assets panel to Node Library to create 'shortcut' of frequently used prefabs.

### Breaking Changes

- [Atlas] `cc.SpriteAtlas.getSpriteFrame` argument changed, now you should pass spriteFrame name without file extension, such as `atlas.getSpriteFrame(‘sheep_run_0’)`.
- [Engine] `cc.loader.loadRes` arguments changed, you should not specify file extension in the url.
- [Engine] `cc.Font` asset type has been changed from RawAsset to Asset, so in component property declaration the type of font asset should be declared as `type: cc.Font` (or cc.BitmapFont / cc.TTFFont)
- [Editor] editor window layout data format changed, if you open a project with Creator v1.1 and then use Creator v1.0 to open it a layout error will occur. You can use main menu's 'Layout->Default' to fix it.
