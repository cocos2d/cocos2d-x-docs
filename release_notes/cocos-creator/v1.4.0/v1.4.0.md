# Cocos Creator 1.4.0 released!

We are excited to release version 1.4.0 of Cocos Creator. Cocos Creator is a new, unified, development tool that handles every step in the game development process.

## Highlights
The most concerning issues and improvements from the community have been addressed, including: 

- Node instantiation performance enhancement
- Spine and DragonBones animation supports mesh rendering
- UI label enhancement, including LabelAtlas support, bitmap font batch rendering (batch with other sprites!), rich text strokes, etc.
- Extension store is online, more editor extension interface is supported
- Include a lot of hot update issue fix and interface improvements
- Add third party library to handle audio soft decoding on android, to improve compatibility and performance
- Added VS Code debugging web platform workflow support

# Major Highlights

## Performance optimization

Node instantiation is an essential operation in game development. Even if there are mechanics such as node pool to help reducing instantiation by looping the nodes, the efficiency of instantiation is also related to the waiting time when the scene is loaded and initialized.

In 1.4, we optimized the instantiation operation by precompiling the CCClass constructor to speed up the creation of Class; In the native platform we achieve more than 80% performance improvement, in other platforms the improvement is also more than 50%. In addition to the huge performance gains that can be enjoyed during runtime, this optimization also dramatically increases the speed of opening complex scenes in the editor.

Also for the Web platform, we also merged the cocos2d-x 3.14 version of the important optimization, including:

- Reduce the depth of the call stack
- Reduce the call stack depth of onEnter / onExit / cleanup
- Reduce the memory usage of the ActionManager / Scheduler / EventManager
- Reduce the use of Color memory
- Optimize RenderCmd and SGNode construct performance
- Reduce the updateProjectionUniform call
- Optimize Vertex data calculation performance

## Spine and DragonBones support mesh rendering

Using mesh rendering to enhance the animation has become increasingly common in Skeleton animations. In 1.4 version we upgrade Spine and DragonBones runtime library to the latest, now in the WebGL rendering mode and the native platform can display mesh perfectly.

It should be noted that since Spine and DragonBones are upgraded to the latest version of the runtime, the exported animation data also need to match the latest version of the Spine and DragonBones software. Canvas rendering mode does not support mesh.

## UI label display enhancement, performance improvement

UI has a major performance improvement in that bitmap fonts can now participate in batch rendering with other bitmap font and sprites! The principle of bmfont batch rendering is the same as that of Sprite, which is to share the same texture and do not have something with different texture renders in between.

Now it's dreams come true to have only one draw call to draw the entire backpack UI. All you need is to put the bitmap font texture and other UI texture into a single Atlas, then in the WebGL and native environment Will be automatically batch rendering.

<img src="c5eae2d4c079ca26b5ffadac4ccf5da425108fe4.jpg" width="406" height="237">

In the above figure we use the editor's own auto atlas function, the folder contains Sprite texture and bitmap font texture, once you build the project you can see the effect of batch rendering.

In addition, UI enhancements also include:

- LabelAtlas supports as a new type of font asset, drag it directly to the Label component's `font` property will render the asset.
- Greatly improved the stability of EditBox, fixed a number of platform compatibility issues.
- Add stroke function to RichText using the `<outline>` tag
- Support choosing targeting object for Widget


## Extension store, new editor extension development workflow and API

Extension store is now online and can be accessed from within Cocos Creator editor. The first bunch of extensions are hand made by your loyal friends at Cocos development team. To be able to browse and download extension user will need to login with their Cocos developer account when editor launches.

With the release of 1.4 version, we also added two important editor extension system workflow:

- You can include runtime components and assets in the extension package, which will be automatically loaded into the project database, allowing users to share control elements and other assets across multiple projects.
- The extension can call the engine interface to access nodes, components, and other runtime scripts in the scene

These two new workflows make it easier for extensions to automate the management of scenes and assets and enhance the usability of editor extension systems in common game projects. Extension store is also open to developers who wish to publish their own packages.

In the future version, we will continue to improve the editor extension system interface.

## Hot update issues fix, interface improvement

1.4 version is the first version of hot update system rework. In this stage we fixed main bugs and improve the hot update system interface to let developer customize their own behavior, the specific changes include:

- (important) To completely isolate the temporary update folder and the local cache folder, to avoid the former failure of the latter, in the confirmation of the new version of the update is completed when the temporary update folder will be merged into the local cache folder (will not delete the old Of the local cache file)
- (important) Binding Downloader file task interface (does not support data task)
- (important) Compressed file decompression logic before the fileSuccess before the guarantee decompression is successful to be the correct file update
- use the size field in the manifest to collect file size data, faster access to accurate byte-level progress
- Fix Android breakpoint support and some special circumstances update bugs
- API that supports the comparison between manifest: setVersionCompareHandle
- Support after the download file check callback: setVerifyCallback
- Support for setting the maximum number of concurrent files when setting up setMaxConcurrentTask
- Protect the correct preservation of tempManifest, so that the progress of information can be stored correctly
- After delaying the file request to the folder creation logic, make sure the path is normal
- Read App Package internal manifest forced to clear search path, to avoid reading to the cache manifest

Follow-up we will combine the editor to further improve the hot update workflow, including the provision of plug-ins automatically generate manifest files, and support through the editor to define the resource package, multiple manifests can be selected updates, etc., so stay tuned.


## increase audio soft decoding on Android to improve compatibility

As the audio decoding program and some Andrews chip is not compatible, in order to solve some of the Android system audio playback crash, we added two software decoding third-party library respectively, corresponding to mp3 and ogg format. The use of software decoding while improving the efficiency of playing the above format audio.

## VS Code debug web version of the game

VS Code is Creator's preferred code editing tool, but before the debug version of the game can only use the built-in Chrome DevTools tool, debugging can not be real-time changes to the source code, the other browser debugging is also easy to take up too much resources to cause the card pause.

In the 1.4 version we added the VS Code debugging workflow, through the menu a key to configure debugging parameters, and improve the compiler script after the sourcemap generation logic to reduce errors. Now you can through VS Code on the web version of the game to conduct a complete debugging workflow!
