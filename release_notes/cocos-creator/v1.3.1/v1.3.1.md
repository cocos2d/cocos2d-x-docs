# Cocos Creator 1.3.1 released!

We are excited to release version 1.3.1 of Cocos Creator. Cocos Creator is a new, unified, development tool that handles every step in the game development process.

This version offers an incredible performance increase for both Web and native platforms. There are 6 major features and numerous small changes in this version that will help Creator meet the needs of more and more types of projects! The following is the highlight of this update:

- Rich text support
- Dragon Bones skeleton animation support
- Prefab automatic synchronization
- Automatically packaging textures to Atlas
- Added UI controls: PageView, Toggle, ToggleGroup, Slider
- New AudioEngine

## Important upgrade instructions

- The Windows version now uses use a 64-bit architecture, there is no longer support for 32-bit Windows systems. The advantage is that the editor can deal with a large number of image resources and improve the efficiency by at least 5 times, but also to support the emerging image format Webp.

## Highlight Features

### Rich text support

With RichText in place, finally you can have a decent chat channel or battle log in your game! The new RichText component can automatically generate different styles of text based on the BBCode tags in the string. Currently supported tags include size, color, b, i, u, img and on, which are used to customize the font size, font color , Bold, Italic, Underline, Image, and Click events. With the help of rich text, you can easily use a small amount of UI elements with a specific string format of the incoming data to display a rich styles of text.

## Dragon Bones skeleton animation support

Responding to the call of users, we have added Dragon Bones ( a very popular skeleton animation editing tool) support in this version. DragonBones component and Spine component works similar. You just need to create a node with DragonBones component, and drag exported DragonBones animation data and image data into the component then it's ready to be played in your scene. You can also customize the properties of the component such as default animation, playback speed and cycle times easily in editor.

## Prefab automatic synchronization

The design of Prefab asset from the beginning is to allow users reuse the resources and elements in the project. But in previous version of Creator once a prefab is dragged into the scene, it will not be automatically synchronized when the prefab asset is updated. This behavior is corrected in the upcoming 1.3 version. When you create a Prefab asset, you can manually choose whether to auto update the Prefab instances in scene.

<img src="e5f0b6e2677b4a0b27cebef7536844f38d5396d0.png" width="308" height="91">

The figure above shows that the instances in the scene are automatically synchronized.

<img src="164137ab2674e953201b7f46cf12aca80c96df38.png" width="308" height="91">

The figure above shows the default state when you create a new prefab, the instance of the Prefab does not automatically synchronize asset changes, which is the old behavior as previous version.

The addition of this little feature will make it easier to maintain a static scene, such as a main menu scene consists of multiple UI menu, each menu can be made Prefab and maintained by a specific person. The maintainer of a prefab can modify their prefab and save changes, other team members will see the updates in the scene as long as they get the prefab assets update. And the scene asset will not be changed at all during the process. This will greatly improving the efficiency of multiple collaborator working on the same scene!

## Add UI controls: PageView, Toggle, ToggleGroup, Slider

To make our UI library even stronger, we add four new UI controls in this version: PageView, Toggle, ToggleGroup and Slider. These new family members will be used in a project importing process from Cocos Studio. Once we make sure there're no compatibility issues we will be able to import any Cocos Studio project into Creator.

<img src="80dfe00626626ec0abc28b839647c46fadbadc2b.jpg" width="523" height="413">

With the addition of RichText and more UI controls, we can finally ensure that users can use Cocos Creator to achieve any desired 2D UI interface. Along side the multi-resolution adaptive UI system and highly integrated base renderer component Sprite and Label all since v1.0, Cocos Creator will give developer an great edge in the development of games with heavy UI content.

## New AudioEngine

Refactored New AudioEngine is still called cc.audioEngine, but the internal implementation has been revamped, to solve the following problems:

- Optimization of the preload process, once the load is completed you can immediately start to play the audio.
- Added API to access to audio duration, and current playback position
- Adds a callback method after the audio has finished playing
- Optimize the audio playback on the Web platform, large-size audio will automatically switch to the Audio module to load, save memory overhead

After the refactory of the audio engine, there is no longer difference between music and effect playback implementation. Although we kept the old API and behavior, you can use the same interface for both types of audio.

## Other important changes

- Build projects with CLI command
- Add ability to specify cross-project shared asset library with `--mount` CLI option
- Refactor the JS-binding API to improve stability, binding API are now consistent with cocos2d-x 3.13.
- Optimize resource caching and loading mechanism
- Refactored cc.Loader to support independent load queues and better progress information. Solved issue to repeated load an asset when there are circular dependencies. Solved issue that may cause callback to fire synchronously.
- Upgrade spine runtime library, support 3.x version of the spine, fix the image mixed mode display problem, support triangle rendering commands
