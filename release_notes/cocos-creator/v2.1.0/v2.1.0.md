# Cocos Creator v2.1.0 Release Notes

__Cocos Creator__ __v2.1__, adds support for 3D features such as: **3D model rendering**, **3D Camera**, **3D skeletal animation**, and **3D point selection**. The __Cocos Creator__ editor now natively supports parsing 3D model files in **FBX format**. It's that simple, no additional workflow is required!

In the previous version, v2.0, __Cocos Creator__ had used a __Cocos3D__ based 3D renderer to officially introduce 3D support. The addition of 3D features can greatly enrich the expressiveness of 2D games, reduce the resource overhead of 2D games, and bring more imagination and ideas to expand games.

However, it should be emphasized that the target users of __Cocos Creator__ is still 2D game development, and the **2D game is still the core** service of __Cocos Creator 2.x__. We will continue to optimize the development experience and basic performance of 2D games, and gradually increase the 3D functions suitable for integration into 2D games. Therefore, __Cocos Creator__ does not allow a pure 3D game, which is the goal of __Cocos3D__. __Cocos Creator's__ development path is closer to 2.5D.

This is not the first time __Cocos__ has upgraded the engine from 2D to 3D. A few years ago, __Cocos2d-x__ expanded to the 3D space and accumulated a lot of experience. It also produced a very good game concept like *Sword and Home*. However, at that time, 3D functions were piled up on a very heavy 2D renderer, and there was no editor support. It was not widely recognized by the market. This time, __Cocos Creator__ is based on __Cocos3D's__ 3D renderer, which has a lot of 3D stability and guarantees a seamless editor experience.

## Follow-up Version Notice

**v2.0 will continue to be maintained, native platform performance will be optimized as soon as possible**

__v2.0__ and __v2.1__ will grow together over a period of time.__v2.0__ will continue to be maintained, adding more performance optimizations and bug fixes. We will soon be beta testing v2.0.7. In v2.0.7 the rendering performance of the engine has been optimized, especially **Spine** and **DragonBones**. Also, the performance has been greatly improved.

**v2.1 iterations will be more aggressive**

Compared with __v2.0__, the upgrade cycle of __v2.1__ will mainly focus on 3D features. We recommend upgrading new projects with 3D requirements to this version, and establishing contact with us on our forums. This allows us and our 3D partners to provide support.Since v2.1 is a very new version, we will speed up the iteration and try to meet the needs of developers. In particular, **currently v2.1.0 version still does not support 3D scene editing, only the 3D parameters can be set in the property inspector**. We will be releasing **v2.1.1** in the near future to support 3D scene editing, material systems and optimizing the 3D development process.

# Complete list of changes (compared to v2.0.5)

## What's New

**3D Node**
In __v2.1__, newly created `Node` objects are still 2D by default. When needed, you only need to click the 2.5D button at the top right of the `Node` to switch to **3D mode**. After switching, you can edit the **z axis**. See [3D Node](http://docs.cocos2d-x.org/creator/2.1/manual/en/3d/3d-node.html).

**3D Camera**
Like `Node`, `Camera` is also divided into two modes. When you add a `Camera` component to a normal 2D node, it becomes a 2D Camera. When you switch `Node` to **3D mode**, `Camera` will also enter **3D mode**, and then you can edit `Camera's` **FOV** and other parameters in **3D mode**.

**3D model import**
Currently, __Cocos Creator__ supports importing 3D model formats for a very wide range of **.fbx** files. **.fbx** is the de-facto standard in 3D modeling software. The process of importing is very simple, just drag the **.fbx** model into the **Explorer** and wait a few moments for the import to complete. After the import is completed, you can see that the imported model is a folder that can be expanded in **Explorer**. When importing the model, the editor will automatically parse the content of the model and generate a **Prefab**, a **Grid**, a **Bone Animation** and other resources. See [Import Models](http://docs.cocos2d-x.org/creator/2.1/manual/en/3d/import-model.html)

**Mesh Renderer Component**
Mesh Renderer is used to draw grid resources. See [Mesh Renderer](http://docs.cocos2d-x.org/creator/2.1/manual/en/3d/mesh-renderer.html).

**Bone Animation Component**
The **Skeletal Animation** component inherits from the **Animation** component. The **Skeletal Animation** component is not much different from the **Animation** component. The exception is the **Skeletal Animation** component uses a clip that can only be a **Skeletal Animation** clip. The **Skeletal Animation** component is automatically added to the model's Prefab when it is imported. See [Bone Animation Component](http://docs.cocos2d-x.org/creator/2.1/manual/en/3d/skeleton-animation.html) for details.

**Optimize automatic gallery build speed**
__v2.1__ greatly optimizes the speed of auto-atlas construction. If the atlas has not changed, the results of the last build are used.

**Further improve rendering performance**
Between __v2.0__ compared to __v1.x__, there are some cases where the engine does not render batches, resulting in an increase in draw calls. __v2.1__ re-optimized these conditions. If the previous **color** or **opacity** cannot be batch processed, **sliced** and **non-sliced** share the same texture and cannot be batched. The problem that the **opacity** 0 node still occupies the draw call is solved.

**Add simulator debugging function**
In the **Project Settings** -> **Preview Run Panel**, the **Open simulator debugger panel** option and the **Wait for debugger connect** option have been added. The purpose of the **Open simulator debugger panel** option is to automatically open the debug window when the simulator previews the project. The **Wait for debugger connect** option is used to suspend the boot process until the debugger connection is complete for debugging the load process.

**Texture Auto Compression**
The compression required by the texture can be set directly in the editor, and __Cocos Creator__ will automatically compress the texture when the project is published. Exporting multiple image formats simultaneously on the web is supported. The engine will automatically download the appropriate format according to the different browsers. See [Compressed Textures](http://docs.cocos2d-x.org/creator/2.1/manual/en/asset-workflow/compress-texture.html) for details.
