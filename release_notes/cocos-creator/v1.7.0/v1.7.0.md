## Cocos Creator 1.7.0 released!
Creator 1.7.0 brings a lot of changes! We hope you enjoy using this release.

### Performance Improvements

- [Engine] JSB 2.0 officially launched, greatly optimizing the native platform operating efficiency. Support debugging, if you use manual bindings, be sure to bind the code to be upgraded. For more information, read the [JSB Binding and Debugging Tutorials] (https://github.com/cocos-creator/cocos2d-x-lite/blob/develop/cocos/scripting/js-bindings/docs/JSB2.0-learning-en.md)
- [Engine] Separate culling and transform calculation steps to improve performance
- [Engine] Fixed bug where the width of the rung would change to 0 after adding the Camera component to the node
- [Animation] Optimize animation components
- [Engine] Optimize native platform camera cropping performance

### What Is Different
- [Editor] The plug-in script "Allow Editor Load" is disabled, the internal display is not checked
- [Build] iPhone X Screen Resolution Support
- [Build] Projects can now exclude un-needed modules for native engine projects. (Project Settings -> Module Config)

- [ProjectSettings] Add __CocosAnalytics__ to the __Services__ tab.
- [ProjectSettings] Increase data validation when saving project settings
- [TypeScript] Upgrade the TypeScript compiler to 2.4.2
- [Editor] Improve the template of the new script
- [Editor] Optimize Explorer file sorting
- [Editor] Explorer to create a new node immediately change the file name state
- [Console] supports setting line height and font size to change log display
- [Engine] Give detailed hints when a user has erroneously released a resource that may still be used
- [Engine] Support mouse event bubbling
- [Engine] Support and WebView interoperability
- [Engine] supports dynamic modification of cc.macro.ENABLE_CULLING

### Demo Projects
The most important source of examples is the __Example Collection__ project template. There are also many demos to show a complete game:

- __[Dark Slash](https://github.com/cocos-creator/tutorial-dark-slash/archive/master.zip)__ basic game loop demo. Special thanks to Veewo Games for authorizing us to use original 'Dark Slash' game resources to make this tutorial.

- [UI Demos](https://github.com/cocos-creator/demo-ui/archive/master.zip) including multi-resolution supporting menu interface with cool transition animations, a backpack generated by data and prefab and a Clash Royale style navigation menu showcase. 
- [Blackjack](https://github.com/cocos-creator/tutorial-blackjack/archive/master.zip) demo, collaboratively developed with Tencent Games. 
- [Flappy Bird](https://github.com/cocos-creator/tutorial-duang-sheep/archive/master.zip) clone featuring a sheep. 
- [Star Catcher](https://github.com/cocos-creator/tutorial-first-game/archive/master.zip) demo game, in user manual we have a quick start tutorial showing how to build this game step by step.

We will keep on adding more demos and complete games as well as improving the existing ones!
