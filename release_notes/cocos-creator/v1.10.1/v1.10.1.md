### Cocos Creator 1.10.1 released!
Cocos Creator 1.10.1 has been released.

#### The following is a list of changes to 1.10.1:
v1.10.1 is a bug fix for the recently released v1.10.0. It is recommended that all v1.10 users update to this version. This version is not an alternative to v2.0, v2.0 is still the current version, and new projects are still recommended to use v2.0. As the last major version before v2.0, we will try our best to maintain stability until we can support users who are temporarily unable to upgrade to v2.0. \

Good quality is important to us. Thank you very much for the feedback from developers through the forum, GitHub, Cocos technical services and other channels. Let us look forward to the upcoming 2.0.1!
