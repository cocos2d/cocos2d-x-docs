### Google Play Instant and Cocos
In March of this year, __Google__ showed __Google Play Instant__, a game store-based distribution solution called *Search Instant*.

For developers, it means they can offer a demo experience to players who wouldn't have installed these games, which in turn will increase the game download conversion rate.

__Google Play Instant__ offers a higher __APK size limit (10MB)__, support for progressive downloads for both executable code and game assets, allowing developers to use the NDK and game engine with existing toolchains. In order to make instant apps and games easier to build, as a __Google Play Instant__ technology access partner, in May of this year, the __Cocos engine__ began to do integration testing with __Google__ and beta users of the __Cocos__ community. 

Developers only need to select __Google Play Instant__ as the publishing platform to automate all technical docking of the __Google Play Instant platform__. The output is compatible with __Google Play Instant__. Technically-standard games, quickly launched on __Google Play Instant__ for testing, greatly reducing development costs.
